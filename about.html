      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Dinner Wizard is an application that provides suggestions on what dish or dishes to make, given a list of ingredients users already have.  </p>
      <div class="col-xs-5"></div><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></span>
      <p>Inspired by <em>The New York Times </em>Cooking 'No-Recipe Wednesdays', Dinner Wizard is meant to help encourage improvisation and experimentation with ingredients while cooking by avoiding giving measurements and phrasing instructions more loosely than what might be expected in a cookbook.</p>
      <div class="col-xs-5"></div><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></span>
      <p>All suggested ingredient ratios are given by volume, uncooked. Similarly, all ingredients listed are assumed to be raw, unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <div class="keyHolding">
         <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right iconKey"></span>This icon indicates that an ingredient can be substituted with others. </p>
         <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-expand iconKey"></span>This icon indicates that this ingredient has its own recipe.</p>
