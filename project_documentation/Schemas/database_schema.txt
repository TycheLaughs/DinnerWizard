Notes about various tables:

ingredient_tags: Shows what broad categories an ingredient can fall under.  For example, spinach can fall under "vegetable" and "green vegetable". Ingredient tags are used both to determine appropriate ingredient substitutions for recipes that use them, and, if the tag has isFilterable set to true, used to create categories on the main page from which to choose ingredients.  A separate ingredient_categories table was not made because in this case, unlike with recipes, categores are just a subset of tags.  In the case of recipes, categories are completely different from tags.

ingredient_tag_map: Shows which ingredients use which tags. 

recipe_equipment_map: Shows which recipes use which equipment.

recipe_filter_categories: A list of all recipe filters "types" that appear on the recipe filter page.  For example, "flavors", "dishes", etc.

recipe_filter_category_tag_map: Shows which categories contain which tags.  For example, category "other" contains tag "under 30 minutes".  Category "dishes" contains "casserole".  And so on.

recipe_ingredient_map: Shows which recipes use which ingredients. isOptional notes whether or not the ingredient can be ignored. replaceableTagID, if it is not null, shows which broad category of ingredients this ingredient can be replaced with.

recipe_tags: All tags that can be applied to a recipe, such as "Mexican" or "Under 30 Minutes"

recipe_tag_map: Shows which recipes use which tags

recipe_replaceable_ingredient_map: Shows which ingredients can be instead for a given ingredient's entry in a recipe.
